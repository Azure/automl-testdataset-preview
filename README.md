# Project

As the maintainer of this project, please make a few updates:

- Improving this README.MD file to provide a great experience
- Updating SUPPORT.MD with content about this project's support experience
- Understanding the security reporting process in SECURITY.MD
- Remove this section from the README

## Requirements

- To use the testing feature, AzureML SDK versions newer than or equal to 1.27 is required.

## Limitations

- The predictions.csv file which is generated by the model test run will be stored
    in the default datastore which gets created when the machine learning workspace
    is created (`workspaceblobstore`). This datastore is visible to all users with
    the same subscription. Do not use this feature if any of the information used for
    or created by the test run needs to remain private.
- Local AutoML runs do not support test runs. To use this feature, please use remote runs.
- ADB/Spark runs do not support test runs.
- Pandas DataFrames are not supported as input test datasets.
    Supported input test dataset types: [Dataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.dataset.dataset?view=azure-ml-py).
- Forecasting runs which have `enable_dnn` set to `True` do not support test runs.
- Forecasting runs do not support train/test split (`test_size`).
- The on-demand model testing feature will not work for runs created with an SDK older than 1.27.
    To use this feature, the run must have been created with SDK version >= 1.27.
- `test_data`/`test_size` is not supported at the same time as `cv_split_column_names`
- `test_data`/`test_size` is not supported at the same time as `cv_splits_indices`
- Test runs are not supported for AutoML runs which have streaming enabled.
